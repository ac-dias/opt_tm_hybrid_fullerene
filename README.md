# opt_tm_hybrid_fullerene
Raw data of the optical transition matrix from the manuscript "Structural, electronic, and optical properties of inorganic and hybrid fullerene networks"

# Data organization

1) Collumn 1-3 -> Kpoint cartesian coordinates
2) Collumn 4 -> Number of occupied states in this Kpoint
3) Collumn 5-6 -> Number of the conduction (nc) and valence (nv) state in the Optical transition 
4) Collumn 7 -> Optical transition Energy
5) Collumn 8 - 13 -> Optical transition matrix elemenst (upper triangle)
